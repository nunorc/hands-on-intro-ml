# Hands-On Introduction to Machine Learning

This repository contains the resources for my introductory hands-on workshop on Machine Learning with Python.
The first part of the workshop gives a quick introduction to the Python programming language,
while briefly discussing some beginners concepts. No background in programming and computer
science is required.

The companion notebooks available from this repository are:

* [Part-1-Intro-Python](./notebooks/Part-1-Intro-Python.ipynb) -- quick and
  brief introduction to the Python programming language and some initial concepts;
* [Part-2-Intro-ML](./notebooks/Part-2-Intro-ML.ipynb) -- introduction to
  Machine Learning concepts with some examples in Python -- coming soon.
